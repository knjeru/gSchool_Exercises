# Galvanize Fullstack Pre-Course Curriculum
Hello, Full-Stackers!

We want to give you major props for your decision to enroll at Galvanize's fullstack immersive. We believe that you have the potential to become an awesome full-stack developer. We also believe that we can help you towards not becoming just a developer, but a master of this craft.

To place you in the best position for success, we've developed a pre-course. During each chapter of this pre-course, you'll be introduced to a foundation of modern web development. The material in these chapters will be invaluable during your first day of class, so please allocate enough time to complete the work. You'll find a huge return on your investment of time.

If you ever need help with the pre-course, please [contact us][contact-us].

## Objectives
Here's the objectives of the pre-course:

students will...

1. [learn the tools of a developer][1]
2. [learn HTML to build a web-page][2]
3. [learn CSS to add style to the web-page][3]
4. [learn JavaScript to add interactivity to the web-page][4]
5. [learn jQuery to simplify the JavaScript][5]
6. [create a personal project][6]

### 1 of 6: Tools of a Developer
In this chapter, you'll be introduced to the tools of a web developer. Everything you learn here will be immediately useful to your daily workflow as a student and, eventually, as a developer.

### 2 of 6: HTML for Structure
In this chapter, you'll be introduced to the language that adds structure and content to all web-pages: HTML. We'll focus on just enough HTML to help you re-create the structure and content of a result's page on IMDB.

### 3 of 6: CSS for Style
In this chapter, you'll be introduced to the language that adds style to web-pages: CSS. We'll take the HTML you wrote during the previous chapter and learn just enough CSS to style your result's page of IMDB.

### 4 of 6: JavaScript for Interactivity
In this chapter, you'll be introduced to the language that adds interactivity to web-pages: JavaScript. We'll learn enough JavaScript to help you eventually manipulate the HTML and CSS you've written.

### 5 of 6: jQuery for Simplified JavaScript
In this chapter, you'll be introduced to JavaScript's most popular library: jQuery. We'll learn enough jQuery to help you fetch data about movies (via AJAX) and to use that data to manipulate a web-page.

### 6 of 6: A Personal Project
In this chapter, you'll build a personal website using all the things you've learned so far. We'll use these personal websites as a way to get to know each other on the first day, so let your personality shine and have fun with it. Good luck!

### 7 of 7: Bonus
All finished? Hungry for more?

## Conclusion
In this document, you've been introduced to the pre-course. During each chapter, you'll not only be introduced to a new topic, but you'll be also given enough information to build a simple web-based application. The knowledge you gain here will form the foundation for what you'll learn during your time here.

## Basic HTML

Write the HTML necessary to match the mockup images. It does not need to be pixel perfect (just eyeball it) but it should be close, with font, layout, and spacing properly accounted for.  Feel free to use CSS to match the mockup as close as you can.

Boilerplate code:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title></title>
   </head>
   <body>

   </body>
</html>
```
