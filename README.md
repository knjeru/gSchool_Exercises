### 2 of 6: HTML for Structure

### 3 of 6: CSS for Style
In this chapter, you'll be introduced to the language that adds style to web-pages: CSS. We'll take the HTML you wrote during the previous chapter and learn just enough CSS to style your result's page of IMDB.

### 4 of 6: JavaScript for Interactivity

### 5 of 6: jQuery for Simplified JavaScript
In this chapter, you'll be introduced to JavaScript's most popular library: jQuery. We'll learn enough jQuery to help you fetch data about movies (via AJAX) and to use that data to manipulate a web-page.

### 6 of 6: A Personal Project
In this chapter, you'll build a personal website using all the things you've learned so far. We'll use these personal websites as a way to get to know each other on the first day, so let your personality shine and have fun with it. Good luck!
